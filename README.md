# Sifat Bhatia

Full-stack web developer (Siftion: “sif-chun”) in Los Angeles. I design and develop modern, animation-rich digital experiences using React, Next.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. I also integrate motion into no-code platforms like Webflow, Squarespace, WordPress + Elementor, prioritizing purpose, performance, and visual precision. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
