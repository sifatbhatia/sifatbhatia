Hey! I’m Sifat, a casual but passionate full-stack web dev diving deep into **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
On a journey to up my UI animation skills, obsessed with cats 🐈‍⬛, tech, and UX psychology.

*Currently studying* at Los Angeles City College (not too seriously 😅)  
Looking for a **steady front-end role** where I can bring cool UI ideas to life.

When not coding, I'm probably pondering user behavior or chilling with my feline friends.

> Let’s connect and make the web more delightful!
